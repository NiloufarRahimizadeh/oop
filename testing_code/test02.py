# Unit Tests and Test Cases
# The module unittest from the Python standard library provides tools for
# testing your code.
import unittest
# A unit test verifies that one specific aspect of a function’s
# behavior is correct.
# A test case is a collection of unit tests that together prove
# that a function behaves as it’s supposed to, within the full range of situa-
# tions you expect it to handle.
