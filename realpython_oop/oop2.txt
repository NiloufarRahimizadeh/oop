Classes vs Instances

Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define 
functions called methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that 
an object created from the class can perform with its data.

you’ll create a Dog class that stores some information about the 
characteristics and behaviors that an individual dog can have.
A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. It doesn’t 
actually contain any data. The Dog class specifies that a name and an 
age are necessary for defining a dog, but it doesn’t contain the name 
or age of any specific dog.

While the class is the blueprint, an instance is an object that is built 
from a class and contains real data. An instance of the Dog class is not
a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual dog with a name, like Miles, who’s 
four years old.
Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. An instance is 
like a form that has been filled out with information. Just like many people 
can fill out the same form with their own unique information, many instances 
can be created from a single class.
